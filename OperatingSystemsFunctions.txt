One of the primary fuctions of the operating sytem is as a memory manager. A memory manager helps the operating system keep track of what is being stored in the RAM and where it is exactly. The second function of the memory manager is to allocate how much memory is allocated to each program.
Another important task carried out by the operating system (OS) is device management. The device manager is responsible for keeping track of and managing all of the internal hardware and peripherals of the computer. Believe it or not, the device manager is even responsible for the running of the hard drive, although it does not keep track of all of the files on the drive. 
Although the OS performs more than three tasks, the final one I will discuss here is file management. As previously stated, although the device manager runs the actual drive, it is not responsible for keeping track of the files, that is the job of the file manager. The file manger does all that it can to keep track of the locations of all of the files on the hard drive and pull them up to the RAM when requested.
